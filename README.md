# EmbeddedSystemsInFPGA
Learning new skills in FPGA direction based on book "Systemy embedded w FPGA" written by Piotr Rzeszut. It can be translated to English as "Embedded systems in FPGA".

## Software
* Quartus
* Eclipse
* Platform Designer
* Pin Planner
* ModelSim-Intel FPGA Edition
* Signal Tap

## Hardware
MAXimator Altera MAX10 FPGA Starter Board

## Problems during tutorial
### * NIOSII Software Build Tools for Eclipse button doesn't trigger any program.
I needed to download NIOSII Software Build Tools for Eclipse from Intel website. This program is not included to the quartus installation.
### * Error: Failed to execute: wsl ./create-this-app â€“no-make
Solution is to download: [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and later by your Linux image wsl, make and dos2unix like:
``` bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install wsl make dos2unix
```
### * System ID not found/ system id parameter is not assigned automatically quartus
Yup... So... Do not be silly and install version from tutorial :smiley: It is 18.1 without the Update 1. It... Works! Probably first time when you start with this book, you will need to face the problems above, but eventually your project will work. My works :smiley: after that change. Folder Project18.1.
